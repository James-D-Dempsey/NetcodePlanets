# NetcodePlanets
Computer Networks Final Project
This project makes use of Unity's Netcode to accomplish a simulation of gravity on different planets with multiple clients.
       1. Multiple Clients are capable of loading into a scene and being controlled individually. Making use of RPC and singleton.
       2. Each Client is accurately effected by different planets gravity depending on current scene.
       3. Demonstrates use of UI elements with working pause and main menu options.
